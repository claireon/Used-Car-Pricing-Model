## Overview
* Created a regrssion model that estimates the prices of used cars to help potential buyers determine their budgets based on the car features.
* The user can insert car brand, body type, year, engine version, registration status and mileage, and the model can predict with 89% accuracy, how much it will cost them.

## Model
- The linear regression model was used applying SKLearn for regression and Seaborn for visualisation
- The model was trained with 80% of the cleaned data and tested with 20%.
